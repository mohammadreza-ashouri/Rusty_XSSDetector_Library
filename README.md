## Rusty XSS: a Rust Library to Protect Rust Code Against XSS Attack


This helper library tp protect backend services against XSS attack, rising from non(correctly)-sanitized inputs from different sources (network, file, db, etc.)
It's also possible to whitelist specific tags (let say your backend logic knows how to handle certain html tags)
It's mainly written to protect your code against XSS, but I may extend that to other forms of cyber attacks.
